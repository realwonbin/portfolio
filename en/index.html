    <h2>Different Lives, Parallel Grounds</h2>
    <h3>Young Lee</h3>
    <p>
      Diverse lives are interconnected through shared structures. I discover and document these structures through photography.
      Traces of life intersect with socio-cultural values, leaving an index that sometimes appears in universal form.
      My practice revolves around collecting the structures of daily life, observing dense intersections with a mindful distance.
      Although no two people are the same, similar lives are repeated. I explore the potential of resonance and structure within that repetition.

        <h3>The Surface of Words: Continuation and Expansion of Signboard Documentation at Hwanghak-dong Market</h3>
        <p>
          This project began by exploring the locality of a traditional secondhand market. Signboards reveal their unique character
          through their typographic forms and categorized wording. This led to the project “Peace and Unification,” which investigates the realities of division,
          while the collection of handwritten signboards has continued steadily.
          The accumulated works were presented in a solo exhibition at Label Gallery, followed by several collaborative projects that expanded the scope of my practice.
          Departing from mechanical repetition, I started using image transfer techniques and overlooked materials. Recent works like “Scales” (using transfers)
          and “Loose Jumper” (using plastic bags) reflect a more assertive approach to typographic forms.

        <h3>The Irreducible: From Nonlinear Time to an Ecological Ethical Sensibility</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by Pak Kyongni’s poem “Jujube and Bee,” this project documents landscapes where urban plants and artifacts intertwine.
          Abstract concepts and emotions are explored through specific subjects and contexts. Sensory acceptance of life, death,
          and the formation and dissolution of subjectivity became a central axis of the work. This was further developed by contemplating the ontological stance of photography,
          gradually shifting the focus from grand ideas to everyday awareness through organically responsive structures.

        <h3>Structures in Progress: Documentation of Events and Discovery of Types</h3>
        <p>
          This project documents modern Japanese-style houses in urban Seoul. Unlike its name, Chungmuro evokes a sense of historical atmosphere.
          As external environments change, perceptions of locality also shift. Increasingly tight networks transcend boundaries and expand flexibly.
          As locality fades, universal structural characteristics begin to emerge. This project follows and documents the flow of types.

      <h2>This Text Does Not Explain the Work</h2>
      More than ever before, I’m trying to understand my own work. Until recently, I didn’t even use the word “work.” It felt unfamiliar—uncomfortable, even. I used to say, simply, “I take photographs.” It wasn’t “my work.” It was just “my photography.”

I gradually sensed that “work” doesn’t just mean a finished product—it includes an attitude, a direction, and the relations it forms. I avoided abstract language because it sounded too declarative. And I hesitated to speak of my work as if it had a clear link to its outcome. But after a few years of submitting to open calls, attending portfolio reviews, I came to believe that I needed to present my work more actively. Still, I felt peripheral, always on the edge of something. I wasn’t eloquent, and I began to wonder whether my first step had been wrong. More than anything, I realized that my fleeting despair was no match for the fact that I no longer had any hope.


      <blockquote>One’s way of living cannot be separated from one’s work. <br>The medium carries the will to surpass its own essence.</blockquote>
      Photography engages time and space more directly than any other medium. Though it’s often grouped with video for convenience, the two are fundamentally different. Video follows a narrative of cause and effect, and through editing, it erases spatial and temporal coordinates to construct its own autonomous world—in that sense, it’s more like painting than documentation. Ultimately, video represents time and space, but photography inhabits them.

The temporality of photography is grounded in physical reality. It responds to the forces of basic mechanics. It operates within a dynamic field entangled with politics, culture, history, society. The subject is not a fixed self, but something that is formed and dissolved as a node within that network. Photography doesn’t merely mark a physical location—it is a point of high relational density. A “field” is the base layer of photography, but it resists containment and always threatens to expand beyond the frame, making its shape unstable.
      <br><blockquote>In a closed system, the total energy remains constant. <br>Energy may change form, but the total amount does not increase or decrease. / The First Law of Thermodynamics</blockquote>
      Psychodynamic theorists believed that the mind has force and direction—that it could be transferred. Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence proposed a vision of affirmation: infinite recombination of finite matter across infinite time. Mental phenomena trace trajectories like physical ones. They form fields of interaction. A work is not merely projection, but an exchange of structured moments—through which individuals recognize each other’s structure and resonate.

Even if each existential form is different, resonance can occur through a repeatable structure—with patterns, amplitudes, and responses shaped in relation.<p></p>

          <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>"Clouds" — an expression of projection or structural equivalence.</em></p><p></p> 
          Alfred Stieglitz published a series of photographs of clouds under the concept of equivalence. He once said, “They are my emotions,” referring to the clouds—an expression that feels more like projection: intuitive, aesthetic, perhaps personal. He didn’t leave a precise explanation, so interpretation remains open.

          Later theorists approached the series through the lens of structural resonance. They read the formation and transformation of the clouds as mirroring the emotional turbulence of the artist’s life. And although no cloud is ever the same—not in his photographs, and not in reality—we still feel something in their repetition.
          
          When someone facing a similar crisis feels an inexplicable connection to those clouds, what’s being shared may not be emotion itself, but a structural response. That is resonance—not in likeness, but in the echo of configurat<br><p></p>

      When someone facing a similar crisis feels an inexplicable connection to those clouds, what’s being shared may not be emotion itself, but a structural response. That is resonance—not in likeness, but in the echo of configuration.

When Henri Cartier-Bresson’s contact sheets were made public, many were disillusioned with the myth of “the decisive moment.” The French title was Images on the Run — the English version, The Decisive Moment.      
      <blockquote>“To me, photography is the recognition of a fact and the precise arrangement of its form in a fraction of a second.” / Henri Cartier-Bresson</blockquote>
      The truth is, his images were repeated efforts—printed in sequence, tightly composed by formal decisions: rhythm, shape, balance. He wasn’t merely capturing a fragment of time; he was constructing a structure that could contain reality itself—beyond time.

Even a “decided” moment radiates from an internal structure. Form becomes content. But for me, that wasn’t enough. I sought more intersections, more moments of resonance between structures beyond individuals.<br><br>

      <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>Pepper." It expresses the formal aesthetics of photography.</em></p><p></p> 
      F64, the group that included Edward Weston, stood opposite Stieglitz. They too rejected pictorialism, but with a different aim. Where Stieglitz sought expressive intuition, F64 aimed for ultimate precision—f/64 being the aperture value that offered complete depth of field.

Weston’s Pepper is a photograph of form. Technical control became aesthetic value. This was not just realism but a discovery of vision itself. The photograph became a relational structure, no longer a representation of reality, but a way to participate in it. <p></p>
          <img src="/images/foreword/becher.jpg" alt="베허부부 작업" style="width: 50%;">
          <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>Anonymous sculptures.” Individuality emerges through the structure of repetition.</em></p><p></p> 
   
          Bernd and Hilla Becher arranged industrial architecture into typologies. Each structure was unique, but part of a collective system. They called them “anonymous sculptures.” Their repetition revealed difference. If there were no differences, typologies couldn’t be found. And if there were no typologies, there’d be no way to perceive difference.

          This way of seeing became a way of relating to others. To find form is to find the conditions under which the other becomes visible.
          
          
       <blockquote>“Death is the possibility in which Dasein is most its own.” / Heidegger <br> “The Other turns me into an object. Under their gaze, I am no longer myself.” / Sartre</blockquote>
      
       We exist temporarily within flow. Existence expands relationally. Death is our most personal structure, but also a type—something we all belong to.

       From this, I attempt to approach the structure of the Other through the structure of myself. That is my ethical distance. It is also my hesitation. I cannot reach the Other. That irreducible distance is the space of resonance. <p></p>

       <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>The photograph does not speak about the person. It reveals through structure alone.</em></p><p></p>

    <h2>The Nearest Things Are the Furthest Away</h2>
    <p>
      To live is to trace constellations in secret.
      More than plausible lives that might exist somewhere,
      the Orion in the night sky feels closer.
      
      In the elevator at dawn,
      the stale smell of rice on someone’s breath
      reminds me of spoonfuls forced down an unwilling body.
      Even with no one watching,
      I couldn’t live that way.
      
      I had to leave before sunrise just to be on time.
      It wasn’t a choice; it was survival.
      
      At the end of the stairs,
      where the sky begins,
      there was Grandma’s gimbap.
      That day, I barely made it through,
      and the next day, I bought a roll.
      Was it 1,000 won? 1,500?
      
      I remember thinking—
      how could she make a living like this?
      My arms ached as I picked up the roll,
      its warmth lingering, barely clinging.
      
      I wondered when she had woken.
      She must have been so tired.
      With no appetite, I tore into it like a wild animal.
      But I couldn’t even clench my fist—
      and thought of her the entire time.
      With an empty stomach like that,
      you can’t even pretend at dignity.
      
      That day, on the stairs—
      a man walked toward me,
      a flickering light behind him.
      His loose jacket fluttered like wings.
      The black plastic bag in his hand—
      maybe a few 200ml milk cartons left?
      The way it swayed wasn’t just weight—
      it was resolve.
      
      But he’d blocked my car.
      The handbrake was pulled,
      no phone number left on the windshield.
      
      Panicked, I checked the interior.
      The back seat window seemed open.
      The car was so transparent it looked invisible.
      I flinched.
      Afraid I might bump into nothing.
      
      Inside were children’s books,
      a pale green milk crate,
      a small blanket—
      a quiet life.
      
      I walked away,
      pretending to be just passing by.
      It was unnecessary.
      But I did it anyway.
      
      I didn’t reject him.
      I backed away.
      Because he was transparent.
      
      Her white blouse shook in the wind,
      her black skirt dragged with a clumsy step,
      and yet—like spring blossoms—she was radiant.
      
      If only she had stayed distant,
      maybe things would have been different.
      
      We were too close.
      And I can only speak of her now that we’re far apart.
      
      She passed away long ago,
      but I held my breath all night.
      
      I wondered how hard it must have been
      to cradle a sleepless night.
      
      The world had overturned,
      and all I did was start an Instagram account.
      That was my grief—
      a mimicry of transparency.
      
      No one saw how I changed.
      But I stayed. I stayed here.
      
      If you’re sad,
      you’re welcome to come.
      
      That was all I could do—perhaps not much, but it was something I could still offer.
