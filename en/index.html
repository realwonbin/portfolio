    <br><h2>엉킨 실타래, 달항아리</h2><br>
      <p>**Entangled Threads, Moon Jar**

A time machine will never appear.
The world is repeatedly reassembled around certain memories.
There is no objective fact to return to, and therefore no use for such a device.
There is no beginning, and no final closure.<br>

If one were to trace my photographs of signs, the portfolio would mark *Manmul Market* (2007) as the starting point. But that was only a result. Or perhaps a cause.
The thread reaches further back.<br>

In 1997 or 1998, after a school trip, my mother scolded me for photographing useless things—explanatory signs and directional markers. Even then, I rarely photographed people.
Ten years earlier, in 1986 or 1987, I walked with my mother along the commercial street across Nambu Market, reading every sign aloud without pause. She praised me at first, then asked me to stop, exhausted.<br>

No photographs remain from that time.
My mother has never been attached to photographs. When we moved to Wonju, everything was lost. One remaining image—perhaps from my first birthday—was given away after a shaman warned that I might die young. I have since outlived my father’s age. Perhaps it worked.<br>

In truth, I am similar.
When I lose rolls of film, or erase original digital files, I simply photograph again. I do not see the world as a chain of specific events, but as a sequence of recurring reorganizations. Still, I resist speaking of this in abstract terms.<br>

Time unraveling endlessly, like a loose thread, holds little meaning for me.
A moon jar appears different depending on where one stands, yet its form remains unchanged. This is why I chose the title. The jar invites the perception of a perfect circle—a geometry that does not exist in reality. A Gestalt world. Perhaps this is the most binding illusion: the helplessness suspended between the ideal and the real.<br>

Losing all my photographs would be difficult, but not impossible.
During a mixed-media class at Keimyung University, we were asked to extend expression by scratching directly onto film. I photographed mannequins through a small window in a locked storage room. There was no alternative viewpoint. I scratched every frame and submitted them all.<br>

I said I could photograph it again.
The professor replied that if I could reproduce the same image, I would receive the highest grade.<br>

I returned. The door was still locked. I stood in the same place.
But the mannequins had moved.<br>

I understood then that the same photograph cannot exist.
This was not merely irreversibility. The configuration had changed, but the room remained sealed. The mannequins were still standing. Nothing essential had altered.<br>

There was no clear trajectory. No dream to follow.
As a child, I may have written “scientist” once. I do not remember anything after that. I entered photography almost accidentally, without even owning a camera. I continue not because of intensity or ambition, but because I do not stop easily.<br>

After returning from military service, I briefly worked harder than usual. I discovered *punctum* too quickly—an unremarkable brown mark on my back. Something I had forgotten until that moment.<br>

Eventually, I began to avoid photographs that produced deliberate discomfort. What Barthes called *punctum* felt less like revelation than an alibi. A justification that escaped structure. I learned to use it when necessary, but I no longer trusted it.<br>

Returning to the foundations of photography felt inevitable.
Photography is a precise record of a moment. This apparent certainty compels doubt toward reality itself. At its limit, it becomes abstract.<br>

What modern photographers achieved was not merely technical mastery, but the opening of conceptual expansion. They made it possible to draw a circle from a moon jar. A closed system formed by imperfect asymmetry and multiple centers. A world without directional progress—only recombination.<br>

Such a world can exist only by accepting the imbalance between what cannot be reconciled.<br>

        <h2>This Text Does Not Explain the Work</h2><br>
        More than ever, I am concerned with how my work is understood by others.
For a long time, I did not call it “work.”
The word felt unfamiliar, slightly uncomfortable.
I would say, simply, “I take photographs.”
Not my work, but my photographs.<br>
        Perhaps this was because I understood that “work” is not simply a result,
but something that takes form through the interaction of attitude,
direction, and relation.
Abstract language often sounds declarative, so I avoided it.
And because work does not necessarily resolve into its outcomes in any clear way,
I postponed naming it as such. <br>
Over the past few years, after going through various open calls
and portfolio reviews, I became more aware of how my work was being received.
I felt positioned at a boundary, at the periphery.
Partly because I am not articulate,
but perhaps the first button had been fastened incorrectly from the beginning.
More than my temporary despair,
I recognized that there was little left to expect.<br>
        <blockquote>A way of living cannot be separated from work.
A medium can move beyond its essence
only through an understanding of that essence,
from which other possibilities may emerge.
</blockquote>
        Photography engages time and space more directly than any other medium.
    Photography and moving image are often grouped together out of convenience,
    but they are fundamentally different.
    Moving image follows a narrative structure of cause and effect,
    and through editing, it erases coordinates of time and space
    to construct an independent spatiotemporal order.
    In this sense, it resembles painting:
    a composed world.
    Ultimately, moving image represents time and space,
    rather than dealing with them directly.<br>
    The spatiotemporal sensibility of photography, on the other hand,
	is bound to concrete physical reality.
	This also means that basic mechanics are at work.
	Within a dynamic field in which political, social, cultural,
	and historical relations are inseparably entangled,
	the subject emerges and disappears as a small field among others.
	Photography is inherently relational,
	as it cannot exist independently.<br>
        <br><blockquote>It occupies physical coordinates,
	    but not merely as positional values—
	    rather, as points of dense relational intersection.
	    The “field” is the foundation of photography,
	    yet it also tends to expand beyond the image frame,
	    blurring its own form.
<br>
        Within a closed system, total energy remains constant.<br>
    Energy may transform into various forms,
    but its total amount does not change.<br>
    — <em>The First Law of Thermodynamics</em> </blockquote>
        Psychodynamic theorists built their frameworks
    on the assumption that the psyche possesses force and direction,
    and that it can be transferred.
    Nietzsche’s concept of eternal recurrence similarly demonstrated
    the possibility of affirmation and will
    through the recombination of finite matter within infinite time.<br>
    Mental phenomena trace trajectories akin to physical laws,
    intertwining as a field,
    and work operates as a process of interaction within it.
    The resulting image goes beyond projection,
    revealing conditions of resonance
    in which structured moments allow recognition
    and response between entities.<br>
Resonance occurs as a structural correspondence—
    repeatable in form and amplitude—
    even when existential forms differ.<br>

<p></p>

            <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>Clouds.</em>
    An expression employing projection
    or structural equivalence.
<p></p> 
        Alfred Stieglitz presented <em>Equivalents</em>
    using the motif of clouds.
    When he suggested that the clouds reflected his emotions,
    this may have been closer to projection—
    an intuitive, aesthetic approach.
    Because he left no explicit explanation,
    we cannot be certain.<br>
 In photographic history,
    the work is often understood
    as a departure from pictorialism
    and the beginning of a subjective practice.
    Later theorists interpreted it
    as structural equivalence:
    the process and form of cloud formation
    resonated in amplitude
    with the artist’s lived fluctuations.<br> 
     Though difficult to separate,
    if someone experiencing a similar impasse
    encounters resonance through Stieglitz’s work,
    that resonance cannot be reduced to emotion alone.
    Empirically,
    no two clouds—neither in a series nor in reality—
    are ever the same.
    Resonance emerges
    not from intuition alone,
    but from a structural response.<br><p></p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>Henri Cartier-Bresson’s contact sheets.
    Repeated exposures
    in pursuit of a complete composition.</em></p><p></p> 
        I understand structural approaches
    as a leap toward non-linear time.
    When an organically changing field is structured,
    it does not remain within sequential,
    causal time,
    but exists independently outside it.<br>

       When Cartier-Bresson’s contact sheets were revealed,
    many may have felt disappointed
    by his notion of the “decisive moment.”
    The French title translates as
    <em>Images à la Sauvette</em>—
    images taken on the run—
    while the English title emphasizes decisiveness.<br>

        
        <blockquote>“For me, photography is the simultaneous recognition
    of an event’s meaning
    and the precise arrangement of forms
    that best articulate it.
    This occurs within a fraction of a second.”<br>
    — <em>Henri Cartier-Bresson</em>
</blockquote>
        Yet the contact sheets reveal
that countless repetitions were necessary
to achieve formal completion
behind a single finished image.<br>
        Through form—rhythm, balance, composition—
    he produced results.
    This was not a slice of linear time,
    but a structural moment
    that relocated reality outside time
    through recombination.<br>  Even if a moment is “decisive,”
    it is articulated
    through an internal structure.
    Form becomes content.
    It was an optimized practice.
    Still,
    I required more intersections—
    moments reached not through individual subjects,
    but through resonance between structures.<br>
        <br><br>
        
        <img src="/images/foreword/weston.jpg" alt="에드워드웨스톤 작업" style="width: 30%;"><br>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em><em>Pepper.</em>
    Expressing photographic form.</em></p><p></p> 
       Opposite Stieglitz stood Group f/64,
    who likewise rejected pictorialism.
    While Stieglitz explored intuitive possibility,
    Group f/64 pursued
    the extremes of photographic clarity.
    Using the f/64 aperture,
    they achieved formal sharpness
    and absolute control.<br>
This represented
    the aesthetic transference
    of an objective photographic vision.
    At the same time,
    photography had already begun
    to extend beyond pictorialism,
    engaging the world
    through internal and external structures,
    expanding into a dynamic field.<br>

        Perhaps form can be more
    than a mode of expression—
    perhaps it is a method
    for approaching essence itself. <p></p>
            <img src="/images/foreword/becher.jpg" alt="베허부부 작업" style="width: 50%;">
            <p style="margin-top: 0.1em;"><em>Anonymous Sculptures.</em>
    Individuality revealed
    through structures of repetition.</p><p></p> 
     
        Bernd and Hilla Becher
    arranged industrial structures in grids
    to enable typological comparison.
    Each building was independent
    yet part of a type,
    revealing aesthetic value
    through the repetition of difference
    and structural sameness.<br>

        They called this
    <em>Anonymous Sculptures</em>.
    By reorganizing dispersed,
    individualized objects
    into structural systems,
    they generated meaning.
    This extends beyond documentation
    into ontology.<br>

         Without difference,
    type cannot be perceived.
    Without type,
    difference cannot be recognized.
    Typology becomes
    a condition
    for the appearance of individuality—
    and a way
    of encountering the other.
<br>
         <blockquote>“Death is the possibility
    of Dasein’s ownmost being.”<br>
    — <em>Martin Heidegger</em><br>
    “The Other turns me into an object.
    Under that gaze,
    I am no longer myself.”<br>
    — <em>Jean-Paul Sartre</em>
</blockquote>
        
        The subject exists temporarily
    within a flow.
    Existence expands toward the other
    through individuality.
    Death,
    uniquely embodied by each subject,
    is an absolute condition of individuality,
    yet it may also function
    as a condition of typology.<br>
    As beings who recognize an end,
    our sense of physical,
    linear time forms a bounded field
    that continues to change organically.
    Individual fields may resonate
    with others through structure.
    Approaching across boundaries
    becomes possible
    through corresponding structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus,
    I perceive and respond
    to the structure of the other
    through my own.
    This is both
    a dismantling
    of the tendency
    to close oneself into completion,
    and an effort
    to expand relational networks
    into a larger field.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a non-destructive,
    non-violent approach—
    my ethical sense of distance.
    It is also my hesitation,
    and the enduring distance
    to the other,
    who can never be identical
    nor fully reached.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resonance is my best attempt—
    one mode of existence.

      <h2>가까운 것들은 가장 멀리 있다</h2><br>
      <p>사는 일은, 사람들 모르게 별자리를 그리는 일이다. 어디에 있을 법한 그럴듯한 삶보다 밤하늘에 펼쳐진 오리온 자리가 더 살갑다. 
        새벽의 엘리베이터에서 날숨에 풍기는 쿰쿰한 밥냄새, 받지 않는 몸에 꾸역꾸역 넘긴 밥술이 떠올랐다. 눈치 주는 사람 없어도 
        나는 그렇게 살 수 없었다. 깜깜할 때 나서야 제 시간에 도착한다. 그건 먹지 않으면 안 될 일이었다. 계단의 끝, 
        어스름한 하늘이 닿는 곳에 할머니의 김밥이 있다. 뭣 모르고 갔다가 간신히 버텨내곤, 다음 날에 김밥 한 줄을 샀다. 천원이었던가, 
        천오백원이었던가. 이렇게 팔아서야 장사가 되겠나 싶다. 욱신거리는 팔뚝으로 통김밥을 집어들었다. 아직 남은 온기를 힘겹게 벗겨내며 
        걸었다. 몇 시에 일어나셨을까, 고단하시겠다. 없는 입맛에 야생의 맹수마냥 거칠게 김밥을 뜯어물었다. 주먹 쥐기 힘들어 제대로 
        먹지 못하면서 나는, 할머니를 생각했다. 채 한줄 못 먹는 배통으론 무엇도 흉내낼 수 없었다. <br><br>
 그날처럼, 계단인지 하늘인지 저 멀리, 남자는 가로등을 등지고 할랑할랑 빛을 깜빡이며 다가왔다. 헐렁한 잠바가 가벼운 
 걸음에 날갯짓을 하는 것 같다. 까만 비닐봉지는 이백미리 우유 몇개 남았을까. 비어가는 봉지를 확인하듯 흔들리는 건, 남자의 의지였다. 
 멀리 가야하는데 내 차를 가로막아 놓았다. 사이드브레이크를 참 정직하게도 걸어놨다. 앞유리에 전화번호도 없다. 당황하던 와중에 혹시 
 연락할 방법이 없을까 안을 살폈다. 뒷좌석 창문이 열려있는지도 모를만큼, 그 차는 투명했다. 가까이 보려다 없는 창에 부딪힐까 움찔 물렀다.
  거기엔 동화책 같은 것들이 어슷하게 쌓여있고, 작은 담요가 가벼워진 초록색 우유박스 하나를 겨우 안고 있다. 나는 모른 척, 멀찌감치 
  그가 볼 수 없는 데까지, 마치 지나가는 사람처럼 걸었다. 굳이 그럴 필요는 없었을걸.<br><br>
 차갑게 밀어냈다. 아니다. 내가 물러난 것이지. 투명한 사람이었으니까. 얇은 바람에도 풍성하게 흔들리던 새하얀 블라우스, 긴 검정치마는 
 어울리지 않게도, 어긋난 팔자걸음 덕에 봄꽃처럼 화려했다. 만약. 그냥 저만치 있었다면 어땠을까. 어딘가 있을 법한 사람보다 더 멀어졌으니.
  너무 멀리 가서 가끔 생각이 난다. 이제, 멀어져야만 말할 수 있는 사람이었는데, 말이 닿지 않는 거리에서 온통 흐드러진다. 이미 오래 전에,
   마지막처럼 굴었다. 새삼스러운 일이다. 네가 세상을 떠났다는 사실에, 밤새 숨을 몰아쉬었다. 잘 수 없는 밤을 품기까지 얼마나 고단했을까. 
   우리는 너무 가까웠는지 모른다. 다시 사람들 모르게 세상이 뒤집어져도, 나에게 생긴 변화는 고작 인스타그램을 시작한 일이다. 흉내 내듯, 
   볼품 없는 내 삶이 조금이라도 투명하기를 바랐다. 진심을 생각할 겨를이 없었다. 나 여기 계속 있다. 누구든 슬프면 와도 좋다. 
   그게 전부였다.
