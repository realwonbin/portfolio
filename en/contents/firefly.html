    <p>
      I once encountered an unfamiliar insect on a mountain trail. Its bloated belly looked threatening enough that I thankfully didn’t dare touch it.
      Upon later checking, I found that if touched, it could leave blisters and scars. I thought it was an invasive species, but it turned out to be native.
      I felt a sense of unfamiliarity like when red cicadas from China were swarming in.<br><br>

      I have seen fireflies twice in my life. The first was during childhood at a river in the countryside when I followed someone on a fishing trip.
      They would light up fiercely and then dim down, and the memory stuck vividly. The second time was while I was on military guard duty in a remote valley near the DMZ.
      I thought they were common there and didn’t pay much attention, but I’ve never seen them again since.
      While it’s said they’re globally common, I still wouldn’t recognize a firefly by appearance—only by its glow.<br><br>

      Sometimes while walking by, I notice unfamiliar new buildings. They have angular piloti structures and shiny dark gray façades that look ready to shatter.
      It’s a familiar scene now—sudden, identical to the ones across the street, even excessive at times.
      If the location weren’t different, you couldn’t tell them apart. No longer distinguished like the “red gate house” of old,
      they are identified by whatever name is posted on the wall.<br><br>

      Old houses sometimes seem alive. Each appears unique as if it has its own face. They adapt, react, grow, and even molt.
      They’re so numerous and aged that they feel familiar but remain ecologically mysterious. You only know them by their glow.
      It’s especially intriguing when buildings use traditional tiled roofs—perhaps camouflage for survival,
      or a way to become native in a strange land.
