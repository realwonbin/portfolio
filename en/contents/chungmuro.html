    <p>
      Chungmuro was formerly known as Jingogae. It was once a key site for transportation and military activities. For a time, I misunderstood the timeline of the name change, assuming it happened after Korea’s liberation. In fact, it was part of Japan’s colonial administrative reform. Ironically, they used Admiral Yi Sun-sin’s posthumous title to glorify Japanese militarism. <br><br>
      This area was home to many Japanese residents and businesses. After their defeat in World War II, they left their houses behind. These buildings became known as “enemy property.” For a while, they were “ownerless houses,” later transferred from the state to private hands. The process was controversial—many pro-Japanese collaborators used it to accumulate wealth. Legal or not, they maintained economic power through deep-rooted deceit and thick-skinned persistence. <br><br>
      Over generations, the past faded. The buildings were repaired, renovated, and gradually settled into daily life. Occasionally, when I glimpse a Japanese-style architectural feature or catch sight of an old wooden beam, it no longer feels like a trace of pain but rather a distant relic of Korea’s modernity. <br><br>
      They never truly left. Their presence remains. On the vibrant streets of Myeong-dong, Bae Yong-joon's smile is certainly not directed at me. It’s oddly familiar, but not entirely welcoming.
