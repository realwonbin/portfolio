    The waterways have shifted, and in the place of erosion lies a layered history. Names stacked upon one another evoke ghosts and transform the space into yet another battlefield. <br>
    Though I had visited the place several times in the past, I now stood in front of General MacArthurâ€™s statue for the first time. Like those who drift without direction, I wandered with my back to the sea.<br><br>
    A half-drunken man, drawn to my large tripod, approached. He vaguely pointed to a newly built apartment complex rising from a redevelopment zoneâ€”one visible from nearly anywhere nearby. He said heâ€™d lived here all his life. After briefly guiding me, he walked off, only to call me back from afar.<br><br>
    Perhaps unsure I believed him, he eagerly led me to a filming location from a recent TV drama. He recognized it right away, having played there as a child: a decaying alley in an old, foreign-style building. After a moment of disinterest, as my eyes wandered elsewhere, he suddenly began reenacting a scene, quoting lines with theatrical flair. Then, worried he might seem odd, he reintroduced himself.<br><br>
    Since I didnâ€™t know the show, the conversation fell flat, and I naturally turned to leave. The bumpy sidewalk was lined with familiar hexagonal blocksâ€”cracked, discolored, seemingly neglected. Or perhaps just barely holding on.<br><br>
    Rather than a fragment of fading history, perhaps what he really wanted to show me was his once-bright, now-shedding scales.
