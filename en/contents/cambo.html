      From the second floor lecture room of Adams Hall at Keimyung University, you could clearly see the Foreign Labor Counseling Center. It had an exotic impression, and I once approached someone from there to model for a portrait photo. Before thinking about the human rights implications that always trailed such attempts, I was drawn to their appearance and had objectified them. It's not that I didnâ€™t understand the difficulties they faced. At least some of it, I grasped on a human level. Cultural differences, unfair treatment, separation from family, and workplace issues donâ€™t have to be directly experienced to be understood. <br><br>
      Migrant workers are often seen as a collective group defined by a macro perspective. Whatâ€™s lacking is a visual foundation to perceive them as individuals. I tried to erase the conceptual categories of culture and circumstance and instead focus on them simply as human beingsâ€”undifferentiated at their core. The approach was to photograph their sleeping faces. <br><br>
      The process of finding participants was difficultâ€”some couldn't agree to be photographed. Reverend Kyungtae Kim from the Daegu Migrant Workers Counseling Center introduced one person. I had heard that he had injured his hand, but I was still caught off guard upon meeting him. I didnâ€™t realize how important a handshake was in a first meeting. I hadnâ€™t even asked his name. My awkward demeanor made the atmosphere tense. I asked for permission to photograph him and quickly left. <br><br>
      Mr. Bunbanna, who had come from Cambodia, said he had spent ten months in a hospital due to an accident. He showed me his legsâ€”I initially mistook the marks for burns. I couldnâ€™t fully understand his explanation, but it seemed that flesh had been taken from his thighs to graft onto his hands and side. Even while preparing for the shoot, I couldnâ€™t help but glance at his right hand repeatedly. After everything was set up, I waited for him to fall asleep.<br><br>
      Sleep is one of the most fundamental human behaviors, and the face is the most minimal indicator of identity. A sleeping face, I believed, could remove the background and circumstances surrounding him. I hoped that a sense of pure, shared humanity would emerge. This work was an attempt to document presence itselfâ€”not circumstance.
