      The Dongdaemun Peace Market was formed as a livelihood base for war-displaced people—originally from mending and selling clothes in makeshift huts. The suffering of war and the poverty that followed must have naturally led to a yearning for peace. The name "Peace Market" has been used officially since 1962 and continues to this day. Traces of the era are still evident, and even now, there are places that exploit the reality of division. Although I was confident of that, I needed to confirm it firsthand—from Ganghwa to Goseong. I met a woman running a sundae soup restaurant, inherited from her mother-in-law from Kaesong; I saw a dried goods shop using 3 and 8 from hwatu cards on its sign; and even a place called "Panmunjom Freshwater Eel" with the UN’s laurel emblem.

      July 27, 1952 marks the armistice—57 years have passed since then. My mother was born that February, so she had no memory of the war. Her harsh life replaced it, and nostalgia is likely preserved only in my grandparents' generation. The once-ubiquitous song “Our Wish is Unification” is rarely heard now. Yet, the idea of unification isn’t easily abandoned. So long as we share a history, the sense of kinship remains, and we are drawn toward reunification—it’s a part of historical process.

      However, a stark contrast exists between historical awareness and current consciousness. The merging of two groups requires social tension and cost. The confusion of unification echoes aspects of war. A relatively stable society tends to respond passively—because "peace" becomes a more urgent demand, just like the name "Peace Market" after the war.

      There are merchants naming their shops Peace, Unification, Kaesong, Longing for Home, Pyongyang, 38th Parallel, and more. Despite having no real ties to division, they use vague nostalgia as merchandise. Perhaps they think of it as selling a local specialty. The meaning of division rarely goes beyond this. As we embrace the reality of division and consume it in our daily lives, the distance between peace and unification only grows.
